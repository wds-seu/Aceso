p,"A prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 40 patients to receive pre-and postinterventional therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel."
i,"The place- bo group received a 300-mg placebo and 500 mg of aspirin 6 to 12 hours before the intervention as a bolus, with a daily dose of 75 mg of placebo and 500 mg of aspirin for 6 months."

o,Endpoints and Extended Follow-up Primary endpoints were the concentration of platelet activation markers using the Chan- dler-Loop vessel model and the rate of 700 CLOPIDOGREL ? ASA VS.
o,The aim of the current secondary analysis was to evalu- ate if the initial benefit seen with 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy compared to aspirin monotherapy would persist after discontinu- ation of clopidogrel.
o,"Secondary endpoints were the clinical development of the patients 6 months after the intervention as reflected by TLR, restenosis, ankle-brachial index (ABI), Rutherford class, serious adverse events (SAE), and days in hospital due to TLR.?"

P,Exclusion criteria were:?
P,"Methods Patients and protocol Between May 2008 and November 2009, patients at 18-80 years with acute STEMI were recruited into this single-blind, randomized control, open-labeled, multicenter exploratory study, who had been successfully reperfused within 12 hours by means of stent implantation and had a substantial residual left ventricular regional wall- motion abnormality on echocardiography, as well as a creatine kinase MB level more than three times the upper reference value.?"
P,"Accordingly, we designed a randomized, single-blinded, multicen- ter trial to evaluate 2-year follow-up safety and efficacy of BMSCs via intracoronary injection in patients with acute STEMI after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).?"
I,"Study design Randomization and baseline examination: Patients were randomly allocated at the ratio of 1:1 to either the BMSCs or control group (standard medication after primary PCI), with use of sequential numbers.?"
I,Cell preparation and administration Bone marrow (80 ml in 2000 IU of heparin) was harvested from each patient in the BMSCs group from the posterior iliac crest under local anesthesia by a hematologist 2-3 days after primary PCI.?
I,"Accordingly, we designed a randomized, single-blinded, multicen- ter trial to evaluate 2-year follow-up safety and efficacy of BMSCs via intracoronary injection in patients with acute STEMI after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).?"
O,"Second- ary endpoints were the incidence of cardiovascular events, total mortality and adverse events at 12 and 24 months' follow-up.?"
O,"The primary end points of the study were the absolute changes in myocardial via- bility and perfusion in the infarcted region measured by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at 6 months after cell infusion, and in global left ventricular ejection fraction measured by two-dimensional echocardiograms at 6,12 and 24 months after cell infusion.?"
O,"gional left ventricular wall motion score, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume and LVEF by using standard methods of the American Society of Echocardiography, 31 and were analyzed independently by 2 experienced observers who were unaware of patients' treatment assignments.?"

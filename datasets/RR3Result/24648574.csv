p,"The exclusion criteria were as follows: known allergy and contraindication to opioids; history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, or neurological deficit; pregnancy; or use of analgesics or sedatives within the 24 hours before surgery."
p,Patients aged 20 to 70 years who had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and were undergoing general anesthesia for elective gastric or colorectal surgery from August 2008 to January 2009 were enrolled consecutively in this study.?
p,"In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study, consecutive adult patients aged 20 to 70 years who were scheduled to undergo general anesthesia for elective gastric or colorectal surgery at the Samsung Seoul Hospital ("
i,"Seoul, Republic of Korea) were randomly assigned to receive 5 mL hydromorphone 0.03 mg/kg or fentanyl 2 g/kg or normal saline."
i,"Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of hydromorphone as a pretreatment drug to reduce the withdrawal movements in response to injection of rocuronium and to attenuate hemodynamic changes to tracheal intubation compared with that of fentanyl and saline.?"
i,The aim of this study was to compare the effects of pretreatment with hydromorphone in reducing rocuronium-induced withdrawal movements and hemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation with the effects of fentanyl and normal saline.?
o,"INTRODUCTION Hydromorphone, a potent -opioid selective agonist with a systemic analgesic onset time of 5 minutes and peak effect time within 10 to 20 minutes, has been used widely for the management of acute postoperative and cancer-related pain.?"
o,"If there was an increase in HR (40% in baseline) and/or increased blood pressure with ST change in electro- cardiography after intubation, IV esmolol (0.3 mg/kg) was available for administra- tion."
o,"In this regard, opioids with longer blood-brain equilibrium and hysteresis (ie, the time lag between peak concentration in the plasma and the effect site) may show immediate analgesic effect via the peripheral opioid receptors at the veins, 3 unlike their known delayed onset of action.?"

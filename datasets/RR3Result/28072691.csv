p,"Patients were eligible when they met the following inclusive criteria: patients with age ranging from 45 to 80 years; diagnosis of an acute cerebral infarction (CI) or TIA; greater than 50% stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), vertebral artery (VA), basilar artery (BA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) alone or in combination; unsuitable or reluctance to perform stent implantation."

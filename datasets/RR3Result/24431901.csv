p,"We excluded patients with cardiogenic shock, life-threaten- ing arrhythmia, advanced renal or hepatic dysfunction, history of previous coronary artery bypass graft, history of hematologic disease and malignancy, major bleeding requiring blood trans- fusion, stroke or transient ischemic attack in the previous 6 mon- ths, use of corticosteroids or antibiotics during the previous month, major surgical procedure in the previous 3 months, car- diopulmonary resuscitation for > 10 min within the previous 2 weeks, positive skin test for penicillin, positive result for viral markers (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV],"
p,Patients were eligi- ble if 1) they were aged 18-70 yr; 2) they had ischemic chest pain for > 30 min; 3) they were admitted to hospital < 24 hr af- ter the onset of chest pain; 4) electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST segment elevation > 1 mm in two consecutive leads in the limb leads or > 2 mm in the precordial leads; and 5) they could be enrolled in the study < 72 hr after successful revasculariza- tion (defined as residual stenosis < 30% of the infarct-related artery [IRA]).?
p,Primary care and randomization All patients were required to have successful revascularization of an IRA on coronary angiography at the time of randomiza- tion.
i,"All patients received aspirin (300 mg loading dose, then 100 mg daily) and clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily) with optimal medical therapy according to the Amer- ican College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treatment of ST-segment elevation myo- cardial infarction (STEMI) (16)(17)(18), including aspirin, clopido- grel, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib- itor (or angiotensin-receptor blocker) and statin unless these drugs were contraindicated.?"
i,Eighty patients with AMI after successful reperfusion therapy were randomly assigned and received an intracoronary administration of autologous BM-derived MSCs into the infarct related artery at 1 month.?
i,"On the day of administration, MSCs were harvested using trypsin and EDTA, washed twice with PBS and once with saline solution, and resuspended to a final concentration of 1 ¡Á 10 6 cells/kg.?"
o,Vol- umetric analyses of LV end-diastole and end-systole at baseline and 6 months and the changes at 6 months showed no signifi- cant differences between groups.?
o,"Follow-up visit and endpoints Study visits were scheduled at 1, 2, and 6 months after hospital admission for the clinical and functional evaluation.?"
o,The primary endpoint of the study was absolute changes in global LVEF from baseline to 6 months after the MSCs adminis- tration measured by SPECT.

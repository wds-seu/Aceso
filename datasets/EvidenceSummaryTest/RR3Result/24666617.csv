p,Copyright Elsevier BV Coronary artery bypass grafting is pivotal in the contemporary management of complex coronary artery disease.?
i,We randomly assigned 219 aspirin-resistant patients according to multiple electrode aggregometry to receive clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (300 mg) or aspirin-monotherapy (300 mg).?
,A total of 224 aspirin-resistant pa- tients with CABG were randomly assigned to receive aspirin only (n ? 110) or aspirin plus clopidogrel (n ? 114).?
o,"The primary end point was a composite outcome of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization assessed at 6 months post-operatively."
,"In conclusion, the addition of clopidogrel in patients found to be aspirin resistant after coronary artery bypass grafting did not reduce the incidence of adverse events, nor did it increase the number of recorded bleeding events."
,"The incidence of the primary end point was analyzed in patient subgroups, stratified according to the presence or absence of individual co-morbidities or clinical charac- teristics."

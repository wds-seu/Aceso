p,"Women were excluded from the study if they had a malpresentation, uterine contractions, suspected cephalo-pelvic disproportion, an estimated fetal weight > 4000 g (by clinical assessment and ultrasonography), maternal age < 18 years, parity of ≥ 5, a favourable cervix (Bishop score > 6), a previous Caesarean section or uterine scar, multiple gestation, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, fetal distress, suspected chorioamnionitis, or a contraindication to vaginal delivery or to administration of prostaglandins ."
,"Women met the inclusion criteria if they were nulliparous or multiparous with a singleton pregnancy between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation, with obstetric or medical indications for induction of labour and an unfavourable cervix (initial Bishop score of ≤ 6), a vertex presentation, a reactive FHR pattern, and absence of uterine contractions."
,"This non-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 228 pregnant women at term with obstetric or medical indications for induction of labour.?"
i,"Conclusion: Oral misoprostol in a dose of 50 ?g every four hours, to a maximum of five doses, has the potential to induce labour as safely and effectively as 25 ?g misoprostol administered vaginally every four hours .?"
,"Conclusion: Oral misoprostol in a dose of 50 ?g every four hours, to a maximum of five doses, has the potential to induce labour as safely and effectively as 25 ?g misoprostol administered vaginally every four hours.?"
,"In each group, misoprostol administration was repeated every four hours in the same dose until regular uterine contractions were established or to a maximum of five doses.?"
o,"The secondary outcome measures used to evaluate the efficacy or safety of treatment included the number of doses of misoprostol needed to effect delivery, requirement for oxytocin, the incidence of failed induction, the rate of CS, maternal adverse effects (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, postpartum hemorrhage, uterine rupture), and neonatal outcomes comprising low Apgar score (< 7 at 5 minutes), incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, need for NICU admission, neonatal seizure within 48 hours of birth, and perinatal mortality rate.?"
,"There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the number of women who delivered within 24 hours or who required oxytocin augmentation of labour, the mode of delivery, and neonatal outcomes (P > 0 .05).?"

p,"Reasons for exclusion included secondary hypertension; systolic blood pressure at least 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure at least 110 mm Hg; treatment with more than four antihypertensive drugs (including components of fi xed- dose combinations); contraindication to discontinuation of present antihypertensive treatment; upper arm circumference greater than 42 cm; presence of coronary artery disease, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, second-degree or third-degree heart block or sick sinus syndrome, heart failure, hypertensive retinopathy (Keith-Wagener-Barker grade III or IV), type 1 diabetes, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin ¡Ý8%), uncontrolled thyroid disease within 3 months of screening, infl ammatory bowel disease or active gastritis, pancreatitis, or renal impairment (estimated glomerular fi ltration rate <60 mL/min); and pregnancy or breastfeeding.?"
p,"Men and women aged 18 years or older were eligible to participate if they had stage 1 or 2 hypertension (Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC7] criteria 2 ) with a recent diastolic blood pressure measurement of at least 90 mm Hg and"
p,"Subgroup analyses for the primary and key secondary effi cacy parameters were done according to participants' sex, body-mass index (<30 kg/m? or ¡Ý30 kg/m?), ethnic origin (Hispanic or not), race (black or non-black), baseline diastolic blood pressure category (<median or ¡Ýmedian), diabetes status (yes or no), and age (<65 years or ¡Ý65 years).?"
i,"Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:2:2:2:2:1) to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with a nebivolol and valsartan fi xed-dose combination (5 and 80 mg/day, 5 and 160 mg/day, or 10 and 160 mg/day), nebivolol monotherapy (5 mg/day or 20 mg/day), valsartan monotherapy (80 mg/day or 160 mg/day), or placebo.?"
i,"The fi xed-dose combination 20 and 320 mg/day group was compared with the nebivolol 40 mg/day and valsartan 320 mg/day groups; if both comparisons were statistically signifi cant (p<0¡¤05), the study was deemed to be positive and the fi xed-dose combination 10 and 160 mg/day and 10 and 320 mg/day groups were compared with their corresponding monotherapy groups, with multiplicity controlled using the Hochberg procedure 15 on the adjusted p values (ie, the maximum of p values for the comparisons of the fi xed- dose combination group versus its corresponding monotherapy groups).?"
i,"Doses were doubled at the beginning of week 5 to fi xed- dose combinations 10 and 160 mg/day, 10 and 320 mg/day, and 20 and 320 mg/day; nebivolol 10 mg/day and 40 mg/day; and valsartan 160 mg/day and 320 mg/day."
o,"Safety and tolerability were assessed by recording adverse events and monitoring vital signs at each visit; by doing physical examinations and electrocardiograph measurements at screening, baseline, and week 8; and by measuring clinical laboratory parameters from blood and urine taken at screening, baseline, and weeks 4 and 8."
o,"Subgroup analyses for the primary and key secondary effi cacy parameters were done according to participants' sex, body-mass index (<30 kg/m? or ¡Ý30 kg/m?), ethnic origin (Hispanic or not), race (black or non-black), baseline diastolic blood pressure category (<median or ¡Ýmedian), diabetes status (yes or no), and age (<65 years or ¡Ý65 years)."
o,The primary effi cacy endpoint was the change in trough seated diastolic blood pressure from baseline to week 8 and the key secondary effi cacy endpoint was change in seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 8.

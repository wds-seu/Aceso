I,"The practical strategies common to the administration of intravenous oxytocin or oral misoprostol solution were as follows: monitoring of FHR and intrapartum uterine activity was performed continuously; in the presence of any tachysystole or hypertonus, or changes in FHR as- sociated with tachysystole or hypertonus, infusion rate was decreased or stopped; intravenous magnesium sulfate (4 g over 30 minutes) could be given at the discretion of the physician if uterine hyperstimulation occurred.?"
I,The oxytocin group received an infusion of 10 IU which was gradually increased.?
I,"In the oxytocin group, infusion rate of 2 mIU/min was prescribed for induction and gradually increased by 2 mIU/min every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 36 mIU/min until adequate uterine contractions were attained."
O,"The secondary parameters used to evaluate efficacy or adverse events included postpartum hemorrhage, abnormal changes in maternal vital signs, and gastrointestinal symp- toms (such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea); regarding to fetal and neonatal status and morbidity Apgar scores, fetal distress or fetal death and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were analysed.?"

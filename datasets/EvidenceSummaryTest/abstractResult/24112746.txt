OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of a titrated oral misoprostol solution compared with vaginal misoprostol tablets for labor induction.
METHODS: A randomized, triple-blind, multicenter clinical trial was conducted between March 2010 and June 2011. 
Women with a single gestation (n=200) were randomized to receive a titrated oral misoprostol solution (initial misoprostol dose 20 ¦Ìg/hour; dose increased by 20 ¦Ìg/hour every 6 hours up to 80 ¦Ìg/hour for a maximum of 48 doses) or vaginal misoprostol tablets (25 ¦Ìg of misoprostol every 6 hours for a maximum of 8 doses). Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for maternal and perinatal outcomes.
RESULTS: The frequencies of vaginal delivery not achieved within 12 hours (RR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62-1.22) and within 24 hours (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 0.83-1.49) were similar in the 2 groups. 
No differences were found in terms of uterine hyperstimulation, unfavorable cervix at 12 and 24 hours, oxytocin augmentation, tachysystole, epidural analgesia, adverse effects, and perinatal outcome. 
Approximately 70% of the women preferred the oral solution.
CONCLUSION: A titrated oral misoprostol solution was as effective and safe for labor induction as vaginal misoprostol tablets.

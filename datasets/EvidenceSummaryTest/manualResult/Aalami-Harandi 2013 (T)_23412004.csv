P,1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| Indução do trabalho de parto por meio de solução oral titulada de misoprostol versus oxitocina em gestação a termo: estudo controlado randomizado Artigo Original Abstract PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of orally administered misoprostol in comparison to intravenously infused oxytocin for labor induction in term pregnant women.,23412004,ml
P,38 ||| Introduction ||| 1.12 ||| Twenty-five patients were excluded for different reasons; 260 were included in the study.,23412004,ml
P,"40 ||| Introduction ||| 1.14 ||| Additional criteria for enrollment were birth weight of maximally 4.000 gram, normal fetal heart rate, cephalic presentation, lack of uterine contractures, and Bishop's score of 6 or less.",23412004,ml
P,39 ||| Introduction ||| 1.13 ||| The inclusion criteria were women aged 18 years or older with a gestational age of 38 to 42 weeks and a singleton pregnancy who had request for elective termination of pregnancy before 42 weeks of gestation or had medical indication for labor induction (hypertension and diabetes).,23412004,ml
P,"55 ||| Study population ||| 3.1 ||| Between 2008 and 2010, a total of 285 term pregnant women whom were candidate for vaginal delivery were assessed for eligibility to enter the study.",23412004,ml
I,"58 ||| Study population ||| 3.4 ||| In the oxytocin group, infusion rate of 2 mIU/min was prescribed for induction and gradually increased by 2 mIU/min every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 36 mIU/min until adequate uterine contractions were attained.",23412004,ml
I,"59 ||| Study population ||| 3.5 ||| In the misoprostol group, a tablet of 200 µg was dissolved in 200 cc of water and 25 cc was administered every 2 hours until adequate uterine contractions were achieved.",23412004,ml
I,"63 ||| Study population ||| 3.9 ||| The practical strategies common to the administration of intravenous oxytocin or oral misoprostol solution were as follows: monitoring of FHR and intrapartum uterine activity was performed continuously; in the presence of any tachysystole or hypertonus, or changes in FHR associated with tachysystole or hypertonus, infusion rate was decreased or stopped; intravenous magnesium sulfate (4 g over 30 minutes) could be given at the discretion of the physician if uterine hyperstimulation occurred.",23412004,ml
I,"104 ||| Discussion ||| 7.4 ||| In our study, a dose of 25 µg which was repeated every 2 hours for up to 24 hours, was orally administered   groups in percentage of vaginal deliveries within the first 12 hours.",23412004,ml
O,125 ||| Discussion ||| 7.25 ||| Vaginal delivery is seen more frequently with misoprostol than oxytocin.,23412004,ml
O,"122 ||| Discussion ||| 7.22 ||| In our trial, the mean times from induction to active phase and induction to delivery were significantly shorter in oxytocin group than in misoprostol group.",23412004,ml
O,"106 ||| Discussion ||| 7.6 ||| The cesarean section rate, latent period and period from induction to vaginal delivery were significantly lower for the misoprostol group other investigation is in favor of one method of induction.",23412004,ml
O,111 ||| Discussion ||| 7.11 ||| Vaginal delivery occurred in 78.9 and 58.7% of misoprostol and oxytocin group respectively (p<0.05) study support the finding that the induction-to-delivery interval with oxytocin is shorter compared with misoprostol (13.1 versus 16.3 hours) 13,23412004,ml

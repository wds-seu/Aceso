P,11 |||  ||| 0.11 ||| RESULTS: A total of 160 women was enrolled in the study.,23999422,ZhouJiaying
P,21 |||  ||| 0.21 ||| The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a stepwise protocol of hourly titrated oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone insert in women scheduled for labor induction.,23999422,ZhouJiaying
P,"22 |||  ||| 0.22 ||| All women admitted to the KAUH (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) for whom induction of labor was indicated by their attending obstetrician, who met the eligibility criteria, and from whom written informed consent was obtained by the physician were enrolled.",23999422,ZhouJiaying
P,23 |||  ||| 0.23 ||| Inclusion criteria included singleton pregnancy of at least 34 weeks' gestation and a baseline Bishop score less than 6.,23999422,ZhouJiaying
P,"24 |||  ||| 0.24 ||| Women with contraindications for use of either drug, previous cesarean section or other uterine surgery, severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (abnormal liver function tests, protein >1 g/d, blood pressure of !160/ 100 mm Hg), parity of 4 or more, or with uterine contractions were excluded.",23999422,ZhouJiaying
P,"38 ||| RESULTS ||| 1.1 ||| A total of 160 women were enrolled between January 2011 and July 2012, of whom 80 were randomized to the misoprostol and 80 to the dinoprostone vaginal insert groups (Figure).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
I,"25 |||  ||| 0.25 ||| Women were randomized into the misoprostol or dinoprostone groups (1:1) using computer-generated numbers, with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes distributed by the obstetrics ward nurse.",23999422,ZhouJiaying
I,"43 ||| RESULTS ||| 1.6 ||| Women in the misoprostol group received a median of 9 (range, 2e11) doses (median dose, 340 mg; range, 40e460 mg).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"42 ||| RESULTS ||| 1.5 ||| Three fourths of the women had a Bishop score of 3 or less at baseline, and postterm was the primary induction indication for 93 (58.1%) women.",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"56 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.12 ||| Proportions achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours were similar between groups for women with previous childbirth (P ¼ .313); however, the proportion of women successfully induced was significantly greater for nulliparous women in the misoprostol group (24 of 51, 58.5%) compared with the dinoprostone vaginal insert group (12 of 36, 33.3%; P ¼ .027).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"57 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.13 ||| In addition, proportions were similar between groups for women with indications for induction other than status postterm, whereas significantly more misoprostol-treated postterm women delivered vaginally within 24 hours (37 of 48, 77.1%) compared with dinoprostonetreated women (25 of 45, 55.6%; P ¼ .028).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"58 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.14 ||| Although more women in the dinoprostone vaginal insert group whose Bishop score at baseline was 4 or 5 had successful induction (17 of 20, 85.0%) compared with the misoprostol group (13 of 21, 61.9%), the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .095).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"59 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.15 ||| Although the induction success was similar in misoprostol group women with baseline Bishop scores of 3 or less compared with 4-5 (P ¼ .346), significantly more women with a baseline Bishop score of 3 or less in the misoprostol group had successful induction (43 of 59, 72.9%) compared with women with low scores in the dinoprostone group (27 of 60, 45.0%; P ¼ .002).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"62 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.18 ||| Similar proportions of patients treated with oxytocin were successfully induced in both groups (P ¼.45); however, in subjects who did not receive oxytocin, significantly more (41 of 44, 93.2%) who were treated with misoprostol delivered vaginally within 24 hours compared with those treated with dinoprostone (21 of 34, 61.8%; P < .001).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"64 ||| STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ||| 2.20 ||| Cesarean deliveries were performed less than 24 hours after treatment in 7 subjects in the dinoprostone group (38.9%), compared with 6 in the misoprostol group (66.7%).",23999422,ZhouJiaying
O,"8 |||  ||| 0.8 ||| The proportion of women who achieved vaginal delivery within 24 hours was significantly greater for nulliparous women in the misoprostol group (24 of 51, 58.5%) compared with the dinoprostone group (12 of 36, 33.3%; P ¼ .0270).",23999422,ZhouJiaying

P,"32 ||| Outcomes ||| 2.6 ||| Subgroup analyses for the primary and key secondary effi cacy parameters were done according to participants' sex, body-mass index (<30 kg/m² or ≥30 kg/m²), ethnic origin (Hispanic or not), race (black or non-black), baseline diastolic blood pressure category (<median or ≥median), diabetes status (yes or no), and age (<65 years or ≥65 years).",24881996,limingqi
P,"50 ||| Results ||| 4.1 ||| Between Jan 6, 2012 (fi rst participant, fi rst visit), and March 15, 2013 (last participant, last visit), 4161 participants were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment, 4118 of whom were included in the intentionto-treat population (fi gure 1).",24881997,limingqi
I,"11 ||| Introduction ||| 1.9 ||| Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:2:2:2:2:1) to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with a nebivolol and valsartan fi xed-dose combination (5 and 80 mg/day, 5 and 160 mg/day, or 10 and 160 mg/day), nebivolol monotherapy (5 mg/day or 20 mg/day), valsartan monotherapy (80 mg/day or 160 mg/day), or placebo.",24881993,limingqi
I,"12 ||| Introduction ||| 1.10 ||| Doses were doubled at the beginning of week 5 to fi xeddose combinations 10 and 160 mg/day, 10 and 320 mg/day, and 20 and 320 mg/day; nebivolol 10 mg/day and 40 mg/day; and valsartan 160 mg/day and 320 mg/day.",24881994,limingqi
I,"28 ||| Outcomes ||| 2.2 ||| Other secondary effi cacy parameters were changes from baseline in mean trough seated diastolic and systolic blood pressure at week 4 and changes in 24-h ABPM values for diastolic and systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 8 for participants assigned to the fi xeddose combination of 20 and 320 mg/day versus 40 mg/day nebivolol and 320 mg/day valsartan; diastolic blood pressure responder rates at week 8 at levels less than 90 mm Hg and less than 80 mm Hg, and systolic blood pressure responder rates at week 8 at levels less than 140 mm Hg and less than 130 mm Hg (20 and 320 mg/day fi xed-dose combination versus nebivolol 40 mg/day and valsartan 320 mg/day).",24881995,limingqi
I,54 ||| Results ||| 4.5 ||| The mean diff erence in diastolic blood pressure between baseline and week 8 ranged from -14·8 mm Hg (SD 9·2) for the 10 and 160 mg/day fi xed-dose combination to −15·7 mm Hg (9·6) for the 20 and 320 mg/day fi xed-dose combination; from -12·7 mm Hg (9·0) fo r nebivolol 10 mg/day to −14·4 mm Hg (9·4) for nebivolol 40 mg/day; and from -10·8 mm Hg (9·6) for valsartan 160 mg/day to −11·2 mm Hg (9·3) for valsartan 320 mg/day (fi gure 2A).,24881998,limingqi
O,"85 ||| Results ||| 4.36 ||| Finally, post-hoc and exploratory fi ndings suggest that the nebivolol and valsartan fi xed-dose combination has a haemodynamic eff ect that includes reductions in both pulse rate and pulse pressure (consistent with pharmacological properties of individual components) 10,15 and that this combination would be eff ective in a wide variety of patients.",24881999,limingqi

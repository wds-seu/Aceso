P,5 |||  ||| 0.5 ||| Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of pretreatment with hydromorphone in reducing rocuronium-induced withdrawal movements and hemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation with the effects of fentanyl and normal saline.,24648574,shizhan
P,20 ||| PATIENTS AND METHODS ||| 1.4 ||| Patients aged 20 to 70 years who had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and were undergoing general anesthesia for elective gastric or colorectal surgery from August 2008 to January 2009 were enrolled consecutively in this study.,24648574,shizhan
I,"6 |||  ||| 0.6 ||| Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study, consecutive adult patients aged 20 to 70 years who were scheduled to undergo general anesthesia for elective gastric or colorectal surgery at the Samsung Seoul Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) were randomly assigned to receive 5 mL hydromorphone 0.03 mg/kg or fentanyl 2 ␮g/kg or normal saline.",24648574,shizhan
I,"62 ||| Statistical Analysis ||| 2.13 ||| A total of 194 patients (hydromorphone group, n ϭ 65; fentanyl group, n ϭ 67; and saline group, n ϭ 62) were enrolled consecutively between August 2008 and January 2009.",24648574,shizhan
I,"24 ||| PATIENTS AND METHODS ||| 1.8 ||| Random allocation of patients into 1 of 3 groups to receive 5 mL of either IV hydromorphone hydrochloride* 0.03 mg/kg (n ϭ 65) or IV fentanyl citrate 2 ␮g/kg (n ϭ 67; Gu Ju Pharm, Seoul, Korea) or IV saline (n ϭ 62; sodium chloride, Joong Wae Pharm, Seoul, Korea) was facilitated by using a computer-generated random number concealed in an envelope.",24648574,shizhan
O,77 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 3.1 ||| This study suggests that hydromorphone may be as effective as fentanyl as a pretreatment drug in reducing withdrawal movements due to rocuronium injection pain and inducing general anesthesia without delay.,24648574,shizhan
O,"83 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 3.7 ||| However, we found that patients in the hydromorphone group had effectively diminished rocuronium injection pain within 90 seconds after injection and blunt cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation with the same efficacy as fentanyl.",24648574,shizhan
O,"81 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 3.5 ||| In terms of onset of action, hydromorphone may not be appropriate for procedures that require a rapid onset time.",24648574,shizhan

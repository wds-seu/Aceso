P,1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| BACKGROUND-It is unclear whether using fetal electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment analysis as an adjunct to conventional intrapartum electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring modifies intrapartum and neonatal outcomes.,26267623,shizhan
P,26 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 5.2 ||| Women with a singleton fetus at more than 36 weeks of gestation who were attempting vaginal delivery and had cervical dilation of 2 to 7 cm were invited to participate.,26267623,shizhan
P,"96 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 23.8 ||| These women are likely to have a lower cesareandelivery rate than the overall rate in all women attempting vaginal delivery, some of whom are undergoing labor induction or in spontaneous labor at less than 2 cm.",26267623,shizhan
P,"27 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 5.3 ||| The main exclusion criteria were noncephalic presentation, planned cesarean delivery, a need for immediate delivery, absent fetal heart-rate variability (amplitude range undetectable) or a sinusoidal pattern, minimal fetal heart-rate variability in the 20 minutes before randomization, or other fetal or maternal conditions that would preclude a trial of labor or the placement of a scalp electrode.",26267623,shizhan
I,"20 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 3.3 ||| Each hospital participated in a pilot phase that consisted of enrollment and care of at least 50 patients monitored with fetal ECG ST-segment analysis, with central review of labor-management decisions and retraining as needed before approval of the hospital to start the trial.",26267623,shizhan
I,"29 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 6.1 ||| After spontaneous or artificial membrane rupture, a Goldtrace fetal scalp electrode (Neoventa Medical) was placed in each woman who consented to participate in the trial.",26267623,shizhan
O,2 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 1.1 ||| CONCLUSIONS-Fetal ECG ST-segment analysis used as an adjunct to conventional intrapartum electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring did not improve perinatal outcomes or decrease operative-delivery rates.,26267623,shizhan
O,"98 ||| Author Manuscript ||| 24.1 ||| In conclusion, this large and closely monitored randomized, controlled trial showed no significant benefit of the adjunctive use of ST-segment analysis in reducing a composite of neonatal outcomes or in reducing cesarean or operative vaginal deliveries in a U.S. population undergoing conventional intrapartum continuous electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring.",26267623,shizhan

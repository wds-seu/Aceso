P,"80 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.36 ||| Given the fact that most patients with peripheral artery disease suffer from systemic atherosclerosis, 36 patients with systemic cardiovascular disease might profit both locally and systemically from dual antiplatelet therapy, particularly as regards a reduction in death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, as reported in the CHARISMA trial.",24093324,zmj
P,"20 ||| METHODS ||| 1.6 ||| In brief, 80 patients (42 men; mean age 70 years) gave written informed consent and were enrolled in the trial according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1).",24093324,zmj
P,"1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| Methods: A prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 40 patients to receive pre-and postinterventional therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.",24093324,zmj
I,"1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| Methods: A prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 40 patients to receive pre-and postinterventional therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.",24093324,zmj
I,"58 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.14 ||| At 12 months after the primary intervention, the positive effect of dual antiplatelet therapy did not persist after discontinuation of clopidogrel.",24093324,zmj

I,"88 ||| Limitations ||| 4.4 ||| Furthermore, new antiplatelet agents, such as ticagrelor or prasugrel, which are now used after coronary interventions, should be assessed in patients with peripheral vascular diseases as well.",24093324,zmj
O,13 |||  ||| 0.13 ||| The results of the MIRROR study showed that patients treated with clopidogrel þ aspirin compared to aspirin alone had significantly lower target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates at 6 months.,24093324,zmj
O,"8 |||  ||| 0.8 ||| Conclusion: In contrast to the first report of a reduction in the TLR at 6 months, this advantage of dual antiplatelet therapy does not persist after stopping clopidogrel.",24093324,zmj
O,"48 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.4 ||| At 6 months, clopidogrel patients had significantly lower rates of TLR compared to placebo patients [2 (5%) vs. 8 (20%), p¼0.04].",24093324,zmj

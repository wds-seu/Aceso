P,"63 ||| Statistical analysis ||| 6.8 ||| Among these patients, 66 received clopidogrel 50 mg plus aspirin, another 66 participants were treated using clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin, and the remaining 68 patients were treated using aspirin alone.",28072691,zmj
P,"66 ||| Statistical analysis ||| 6.11 ||| In all 200 patients, the median age was 62 years, and 79 (39.5%) patients were female.",28072691,zmj
I,"63 ||| Statistical analysis ||| 6.8 ||| Among these patients, 66 received clopidogrel 50 mg plus aspirin, another 66 participants were treated using clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin, and the remaining 68 patients were treated using aspirin alone.",28072691,zmj
I,"38 ||| Participants ||| 4.16 ||| Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive aspirin alone (100 mg), or clopidogrel (50 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg), or clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg).",28072691,zmj
I,40 ||| Participants ||| 4.18 ||| Patients in clopidogrel (50 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg) group received clopidogrel at a dose of 50 mg/d and aspirin in a dose of 100 mg daily on day 1 through 90 days.,28072691,zmj
I,41 ||| Participants ||| 4.19 ||| Cases in clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg) group received clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg/d and aspirin at a dose of 100 mg/d on day 1 through 90 days.,28072691,zmj
I,"7 |||  ||| 0.7 ||| Ischemic stroke occurred in 6 patients (9.1%) treated with 50 mg clopidogrel and aspirin, 6 patients (9.1%) receiving 75 mg clopidogrel and aspirin, whereas 19 patients (27.9%) in the aspirin group (aspirin alone vs copidogrel 50 mg plus aspirin; 95% confidence intervals 1.704-23.779, P < 0.05; aspirin alone vs copidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin; 95% confidence intervals 1.190-13.240, P < 0.05).",28072691,zmj
I,"4 |||  ||| 0.4 ||| We randomly assigned these patients to receive clopidogrel (75 or 50 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg) or aspirin (100 mg) once daily through 90 days, and followed them for 90 days.",28072691,zmj
O,"79 ||| Statistical analysis ||| 6.24 ||| Both dual antiplatelet therapeutic approaches (copidogrel 50 mg plus aspirin, and copidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin) showed an obvious decrease in the recurrence of ischemic stroke (P < 0.05), comparing with that of the patients treated by aspirin alone.",28072691,zmj
O,"131 ||| Discussion ||| 7.44 ||| Taken together, our findings indicated that the use of 50 mg clopidogrel plus aspirin, and 75 mg clopidogrel plus aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in the aspect of reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke for patients with ICVD and intracranial and extracranial arteriostenosis.",28072691,zmj
O,"10 |||  ||| 0.10 ||| Conclusion: Accordingly, 50 mg clopidogrel plus aspirin, and 75 mg clopidogrel plus aspirin were all superior to aspirin alone as stroke prevention in patients with cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack combined with intracranial and extracranial arteriostenosis.",28072691,zmj

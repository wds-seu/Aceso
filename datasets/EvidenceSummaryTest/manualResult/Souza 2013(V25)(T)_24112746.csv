P,18 ||| Introduction ||| 1.9 ||| The present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness and safety of a titrated oral homogenized misoprostol solution compared with vaginal misoprostol tablets for the induction of labor in full-term live pregnancies.,24112746,ZhouJiaying
P,"24 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.6 ||| Assuming these rates, a sample of 184 women would be needed to achieve a significance level of 5% and a statistical power of 80%.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
P,"26 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.8 ||| The inclusion criteria were single live pregnancy, pregnancy duration of 37 weeks or more, indication for labor induction (hypertension, premature rupture of membranes, diabetes, or pregnancy duration of 41 weeks or more), vertex presentation, estimated fetal weight of less than 4000 g according to ultrasonography, amniotic fluid index of more than 5 cm, and modified Bishop score of 6 or less.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
P,3 |||  ||| 0.3 ||| Women with a single gestation (n = 200) were randomized to receive a titrated oral misoprostol solution (initial misoprostol dose 20 μg/hour; dose increased by 20 μg/hour every 6 hours up to 80 μg/hour for a maximum of 48 doses) or vaginal misoprostol tablets (25 μg of misoprostol every 6 hours for a maximum of 8 doses).,24112746,ZhouJiaying
P,"64 ||| Results ||| 3.1 ||| During the study period, 450 women were referred to the participating hospitals for labor induction (Fig.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
P,"66 ||| Results ||| 3.3 ||| Therefore, 200 women remained in the study, 100 of whom were randomly assigned to the oral misoprostol solution group and 100 to the vaginal misoprostol group.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,"29 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.11 ||| All women included in the study were accompanied according to standard routine for their clinical condition, and fetal well-being was evaluated by intermittent fetal auscultation or intrapartum cardiotocography [19].",24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,3 |||  ||| 0.3 ||| Women with a single gestation (n = 200) were randomized to receive a titrated oral misoprostol solution (initial misoprostol dose 20 μg/hour; dose increased by 20 μg/hour every 6 hours up to 80 μg/hour for a maximum of 48 doses) or vaginal misoprostol tablets (25 μg of misoprostol every 6 hours for a maximum of 8 doses).,24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,"31 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.13 ||| Numbers from 1 to 200 were randomly allocated to 2 groups designated A and B, and the resulting lists were sent to the pharmaceutical company in charge of the drug preparation.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,"39 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.21 ||| The initial dose of the oral solution was 20 μg/hour (10 mL/hour) of misoprostol or 10 mL/hour of placebo for the first 6 hours, which was increased by 20 μg/hour (10 mL/hour) every 6 hours by the attending nurse with a calibrated medicine cup if labor was not induced (maximum dose 80 μg/hour or until the 48th dose).",24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,40 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.22 ||| The vaginal tablet (25 μg misoprostol or placebo) was placed into the posterior fornix by the attending physician every 6 hours (maximum dose 200 μg or 8 tablets).,24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,"47 ||| Materials and methods ||| 2.29 ||| A non-reassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern, evaluated using cardiotocography or intermittent fetal auscultation, was defined as the persistence of a baseline FHR of less than 110 bpm, presence of late FHR decelerations (reduction in FHR following uterine contractions), or presence of fetal tachycardia (persistent FHR of more than 160 bpm) [19].",24112746,ZhouJiaying
I,"66 ||| Results ||| 3.3 ||| Therefore, 200 women remained in the study, 100 of whom were randomly assigned to the oral misoprostol solution group and 100 to the vaginal misoprostol group.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
O,7 |||  ||| 0.7 ||| Approximately 70% of the women preferred the oral solution.,24112746,ZhouJiaying
O,"73 ||| Results ||| 3.10 ||| Of the 92 women who required oxytocin,   44 (47.8%) delivered within 24 hours in the oral group and 48 (52.2%) in the vaginal group (P = 0.69).",24112746,ZhouJiaying
O,"85 ||| Results ||| 3.22 ||| With respect to the mother's preference regarding the route of administration, 69.5% (95% CI, 62.6-75.8%) of the women reported that they would prefer the oral solution to the vaginal tablets should they need to use the drug to induce labor in a subsequent pregnancy.",24112746,ZhouJiaying
O,"99 ||| Discussion ||| 4.14 ||| The Cochrane review [3] reported a greater need for oxytocin in women using oral misoprostol (57%) than in those with vaginal administration (51%), a finding that is in agreement with the results from another randomized controlled trial [13].",24112746,ZhouJiaying

P,"37 ||| Methods ||| 2.2 ||| Between May 2008 and November 2009, patients at 18-80 years with acute STEMI were recruited into this single-blind, randomized control, open-labeled, multicenter exploratory study, who had been successfully reperfused within 12 hours by means of stent implantation and had a substantial residual left ventricular regional wallmotion abnormality on echocardiography, as well as a creatine kinase MB level more than three times the upper reference value.",23651816,lingtaiwei
I,"51 ||| Methods ||| 2.16 ||| A 17-segment echocardiogram was performed to measure regional left ventricular wall motion score, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume and LVEF by using standard methods of the American Society of Echocardiography, 31 and",23651816,lingtaiwei
I,"86 ||| Baseline characteristics ||| 5.13 ||| Similar with other patients, this patient was withdrawn 80 ml of bone marrow for BMSCs preparation, but the culture time to harvest P2 BMSCs was prolonged to 22 days in order to meet the minimum clinical-grade cell quantity requirement.",23651816,lingtaiwei
I,"94 ||| Baseline characteristics ||| 5.21 ||| However, the major adverse cardiac events of death, recurrence of myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for heart failure did not differ significantly between the two groups during 24 months of follow-up (Table 2).",23651816,lingtaiwei
O,"10 ||| Introduction ||| 1.1 ||| Randomized, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that there is a significant, but small improvement in LV function in autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells therapy following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [1][2][3][4][5][6].",23651816,lingtaiwei
O,"16 ||| Introduction ||| 1.7 ||| Two small non-randomized studies that used intracoronary bone marrowderived MSCs (BMSCs) in patients after AMI showed that no serious treatment-related side effects and significant short-term improvements in LVEF and SPECT perfusion were reported [17,18].",23651816,lingtaiwei
O,145 ||| Conclusion ||| 8.1 ||| We report for the first time that AMI-related changes in the numerical yield of BMSCs resulted in failing to improve myocardial viability and function in human clinical setting.,23651816,lingtaiwei

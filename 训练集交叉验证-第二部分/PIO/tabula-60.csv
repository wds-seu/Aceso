"",BLINDING
"",- Double-blind
"",- Placebo-controlled
"",- Identical placebo
"",WITHDRAWALS
"",- 2 described in IVIG group
Participants,INCLUSION CRITERIA
"",- First episode of rheumatic fever diagnosed according to Jones criteria 1965 and 1992
"",- Time to treatment not indicated
"",RANDOMLY ASSIGNED (N = 61)
"",- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) = 29
"",- Placebo = 32
"",CARDITIS (N = 39)
"","IVIG = 17, placebo = 22"
"",SEVERITY OF CARDITIS BASED ON ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS AT
"",START
"","- SEVERE: IVIG = 0, placebo = 2"
"","- MODERATE: IVIG = 6, placebo = 9"
"","- MILD: IVIG = 8, placebo = 9"
"","- SUBCLINICAL: IVIG = 9, placebo = 9"
"",WITHDRAWALS
"",- IVIG = 2
"",AGE (average in years)
"",- IVIG = 11.2 (2)
"",- Placebo = 11 (3)
"",SEX (M:F)
"",- IVIG = 14:13
"",- Control = 19:13

"","- IVIG 1 g/kg days 0 and 1, then 0.4 mg/kg days 14 and 28"
"",CONTROL GROUP
"","- Placebo (4% dextrose, 0.18% normal saline)"
"",CO-TREATMENT
"",- Bed/chair rest × 2 wk
"",- Oral penicillin × 2 wk
"",- imi benzathine penicillin at discharge
"",- Salicylates for relief of arthritis
Outcomes,ANALYSIS
"",- Intention-to-treat not specified
"",PRESENCE OF CARDITIS AT 1 YEAR
"",(CARDITIS = defined by the presence of an aortic or mitral murmur clinically and
"",aortic or mitral regurgitation by echocardiographic evaluation; echocardiography adds
"",only a few more participants)
"",PARTICIPANTS WITH CARDITIS AT 1 YEAR
"",- IVIG = 14/27
"",(2 withdrawals)
"",- Placebo = 19/32
"",CARDIAC OUTCOMES ACCORDING TO SEVERITY AT 1 YEAR
"","- SEVERE: IVIG = 1, placebo = 1/2"
"","- MOD: IVIG = 2/6, placebo = 6/9"
"","- MILD: IVIG = 4/8, placebo = 4/9"
"","- SUBCLINICAL: IVIG = 7/9, placebo = 8/9"
"",(moderate & severe groups analysed together)
"",OTHER OUTCOMES
"",- ESR and CRP similar in the 2 groups at 6-week follow-up. ESR was significantly higher
"","in IVIG group at 2 weeks, but this did not persist"

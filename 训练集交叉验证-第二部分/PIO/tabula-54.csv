"","Randomised: Control: 48, Intervention: 98"
"","Age (mean in years): Control: 55, Intervention: 55"
"","% Male gender: Control: 77, Intervention: 77.5"
Interventions,Control: Participants were treated depending on physician’s choice and according to
"",current guidelines. Discontinuation of the antiarrhythmic treatment was not required
"",before inclusion in the ADT group. There was no predefined protocol on the use of
"",ADT during the blanking period
"",Intervention: Pulmonary vein ablation. Antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued ≥ 5
"",half-life periods (or ≥ 1 week for amiodarone) before ablation; antiarrhythmics were
"",reinitiated immediately after CA for the blanking period
"",3-month blanking period.
Outcomes,Analysis was by intention-to-treat
"",Primary outcomes
"",1. Freedom from atrial arrhythmias
"","Control: 43.7%, Intervention: 70.4%"

Stabile 2006,
Methods,RCT
Participants,Country: Italy
"",Inclusion criteria: Participants with paroxysmal or persistent AF who were intolerant of
"",antiarrhythmic drugs or in whom two or more antiarrhythmic drug regimens had failed
"",Exclusion criteria:
"",• Age < 18 or > 80 years
"",• Permanent AF (AF was the sole rhythm for the last 12 months)
"","• AF secondary to a transient or correctable abnormality, including electrolyte"
"","imbalance, trauma, recent surgery, infection, toxic ingestion, and endocrinopathy"
"",• Persistence of AF episodes triggered by another uniform arrhythmia (i.e. atrial
"",flutter or atrial tachycardia) despite previous supraventricular tachycardia ablation
"","• Intra-atrial thrombus, tumour, or other abnormality precluding catheter insertion"
"",• Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
"",• Heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV or ejection
"",fraction ≤ 35%

"","Age (mean in years): Control: 62.3, Intervention: 62.2"
"","%Male gender: Control: 64, Intervention: 54"
Interventions,Control: The antiarrhythmic drug preferentially administered was amiodarone. In par-
"","ticipants with history of intolerance to amiodarone, a class IC antiarrhythmic was ad-"
"",ministered. The final decision was left to the physician
"","Intervention: Pulmonary vein isolation, circumferential ablation, plus left atrial linear"
"",lesion ± cavo-tricuspid isthmus
